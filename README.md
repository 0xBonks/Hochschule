# Munich University of Applied Sciences Software Development Tasks

This is a collection of all the tasks I have received so far (as of 01/2025) in the module **Software Development I**. More tasks will follow.

### What's next?
The fun continues in the second semester with **Software Development II**, likely including an individual project, along with the modules **Software Engineering I/II**.
